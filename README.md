# -FORECASTING-GLOBAL-ENERGY-CONSUMPTION-USING-DIFFERENT-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS--Capstone
Forecasting global energy consumption is a crucial task for policymakers, energy companies, and investors as it helps in making informed decisions regarding energy production and consumption. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for analysing energy data and making accurate predictions. In this topic, we will explore the application of various machine learning algorithms for forecasting global energy consumption. We will discuss the pros and cons of different models, their suitability for various types of data, and the challenges associated with energy consumption forecasting. This topic will provide insights into the techniques used in energy consumption prediction and their potential to contribute to sustainable energy planning and management. 
Used different machine learning models to predict the future consumption of energy from different sources such as Coal, Oil, Nuclear, Gas, Solar Hydro,Wind. 
Models were implemented on the world as a whole and on different major countries to get the exact values of consumption
